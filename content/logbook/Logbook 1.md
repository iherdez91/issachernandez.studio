### The build

- I attempted to use wordpress for years. It always felt clunky and unintuitive. And it never looked "right." It was so slow to use, to update, making it utterly useless. 
- Made the decision to move away from wordpress. I tackled Framer. After a day of learning their platform and falling in love with the GUI I discovered their pricing model. It's disgusting. 

### HUGO 
I would have never imagined that I would use something like Hugo. Mainly because I don't know coding. I took a shot at it and was extremely impressed. Using Claude I've managed to code this entire site. I had ideas and they were brought to life with this workflow.
