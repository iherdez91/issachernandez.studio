The biggest challenge I face in my day job (Teaching high school music) is sequencing and keeping up with planning documents. Working on a solution. A magic filing cabinet. It's just an idea but I'm hoping it solves that problem.

The site is up and running. Putting the finishing touches on functionality, It's time to start making things.
